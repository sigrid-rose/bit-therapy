|Windows (Beta)|Some day!|[Latest Beta](https://github.com/curzel-it/bit-therapy/releases/tag/windows-v1.0.0)|[See instructions](#build-windows)|

I'm currently rewriting the app in [C++](https://github.com/curzel-it/bit-therapy-cpp) with QT, the primary goal is to learn more about the language.

## ü§î What's a Desktop Pet?
It's just a cute little pet or animal that lives in your computer.

The most popular one was probably the [eSheep](https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet) for Windows 95.

Hope you like them too!

## üé® Create custom pets
Starting from version 2.20 you can now create custom pets, please check [the documentation](https://curzel.it/bit-therapy/custompets).

You do not need any programming knowledge or dev tools to create your own pets, just design your characters and follow [the instructions](https://curzel.it/bit-therapy/custompets), good luck!

## ‚õìÔ∏è Command Line
* For integrating with the App Store / production app, see [interoperability](#interoperability)
* For using it as a command line tool, see [the C++ / QT version](https://github.com/curzel-it/bit-therapy-cpp)

## üîî Interoperability 
<a name="interoperability"></a>
Since version 2.48 you can use `DistributedNotificationCenter` to send basic commands to your pets.

Here's the payload:
```json
{
    "subject": "sloth",
    "action": "eat",
    "x": 100,
    "y": 100
}
```
* `x` and `y` are optional
* `subject` is the id of a species
* `action` the id of an animation
You can look up species and their animations [here](https://github.com/curzel-it/bit-therapy/tree/main/Species).

Sample Python script to send out notifications:
```python
from Foundation import NSDistributedNotificationCenter, NSDictionary

def send_notification():
    notification_name = "it.curzel.pets.Api"
    message = {...}
    user_info = NSDictionary.dictionaryWithDictionary_(message)
    center = NSDistributedNotificationCenter.defaultCenter()
    center.postNotificationName_object_userInfo_deliverImmediately_(
        notification_name, None, user_info, True
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_notification()
```

## FAQ
### Linux Support?
The app works by creating a transparent full screen window, which displays a bunch of sprites.

The app relies on the fact that both macOS and Windows discards events (such as mouse clicks) that happen on a completely trasparent porting of the window. This way, the app is unable to track events and doens't get in the way of you using other apps.

* Can this work on Linux? Sure
* Have you tried Wine? Not yet (chances of success do seem quite low)
* Do I want to figure out how to make this work on X or Wayland? Nope....

Sorry!
